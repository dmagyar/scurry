A VPN system without a central server (peer-to-peer) written in Haskell.

# Notes #
## Scurry Doesn't Have... ##
  * Security (no encryption)

## Scurry DOES Have ##
  * Automatic Address Assignment
  * Ability to emulate a LAN between any number of machines.
  * Automatic NAT Punching (Skype firewall punching)
  * Smart packet switching (best attempt switching. if the hardware address isn't recognized, the packet is broadcast)

# Software Status #
Scurry is in super mega experimental mode. While I don't think this software will kill your dog or cause a gamma ray burst within 100 light years, it might. Use at your own risk.
