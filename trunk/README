How to run the initial point-to-point proof of concept:

# Machine 1 with IP address 192.168.128.50
# Machine 2 with IP address 192.168.128.53

# Usage:
./scurry [local tap ip] [local addr] [local port] [remote addr] [remote port]

# Run on Machine 1
sudo ./scurry 10.0.0.1 0.0.0.0 24999 192.168.128.53 24999

# Run on Machine 2
sudo ./scurry 10.0.0.2 0.0.0.0 24999 192.168.128.50 24999

# Use the network from Machine 1
ping 10.0.0.2

# Use the network from Machine 2
ping 10.0.0.1
