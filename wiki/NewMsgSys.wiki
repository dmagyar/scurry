# New method for managing asyncronous messages inside Scurry.

= Introduction =

The current Scurry management messaging model isn't very good. We have one task generate messages on a time or need based model, but another task catches the responses and updates the state of the system. This produces at least two problems:
  * The code does not read as plainly as I would like
  * The program requires some sort of synchronizing state variable. Eventually I would like to remove all explicit state from the program (no IORef's or MVar's that are used for long term state storage).
