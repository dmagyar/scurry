#summary How to use Scurry

= Introduction =

This is a short description which will help you get Scurry running on various platforms.


= Linux =
  * Checkout the scurry project.
    * svn checkout http://scurry.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ scurry
  * cd scurry
  * Edit 'files/config.json'
    * The "vpn" object defines the IP and netmask which will be used on the VPN.
    * The "network" object defines the IP and port upon which scurry will listen for connections from other peers.
  * Edit 'files/tracker.json'
    * This is an array of peers.
    * Each peer in the array needs a host address and a port number.
    * Scurry will attempt to open communication channels with these peers when it starts.
  * runhaskell Setup configure
  * runhaskell Setup build
  * Since we're creating a network device, we'll need to run the following command as root.
  * sudo ./dist/build/scurry/scurry files/config.json files/tracker.json
  * Once the Scurry starts, you'll notice that you have a new tapX device when you run ifconfig. It will have the netmask and IP address set in 'files/config.json'.

= Windows =
Currently, Windows is not supported. It's in the works.

= OS/X =
  * Install [http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/ TUNTAP driver] for OS X

= FreeBSD (possibly others) =
  * Run 'kldload if_tap'
